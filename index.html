                    There are excellent modern facilities available in the school library to the students and members of staff to make studies here much easier and more interesting. The two areas that affect users the most are the information technology and library facilities. The library is equipped with a high profile automation software that facilitates easy selection of books based on the choice of an individual.
                    The School has two libraries - each for Senior Wing (Central Library) and Junior Wing. Both libraries provide online access to a number of abstracts on various topics, through a browser-based support of the software. The Library has a huge collection of over 18,000 books and the number is on a gradual increase. It aims at facilitating reading habits among students and provide them an atmosphere where they can sit freely, think freely and develop their analytical skills.

                    The onus for shrinking the entire world to the size of a small family should go to none other than the intelligent chap called computer. To keep our wizards abreast with the latest technology, OPJMS has two workplaces for computer students where they have a rendezvous with Pentium. Our students, from class-I onwards, are given preliminary exposure to the fascinating and astonishing ’World of Computers’. All the equipments in the labs are upgraded with multimedia facilities. An online network of workstations and knowledge makes learning fast and convenient for students. Each student is given an opportunity to work on a single system.

                IMC RBNQA Trust confers awards in four different categories – Manufacturing, Service, Health Care and Education. Akin to the Malcolm Baldrige criteria of USA, the organization of international stature subjects its aspirants to a rigorous training and exhaustive evaluation process conducted in four stages. Successful completion of three stages led to the final stage of site visit made by 3 certified examiners from Indian Merchant’s Chamber for an inspection to assess risk management, governance, deployment of green strategies, interaction with stakeholders, employees and determination of benchmarks for best practices. The school successfully waded through these four stages of evaluation process.

                Since its genesis in 1997, the pursuit of Quality and quest for excellence in education has always fuelled OPJMS into the frenzy of action to challenge the conventional teaching and learning practices and to establish itself as the vanguard of innovation and new developments in education. It is this spirit of innovations and ardent desire of OPJMS to push its own limits that has culminated in much-coveted National Education Excellence Award 2013 being conferred on OPJMS by ASSOCHAM, an Apex Chamber set up in 1920 for Trade and Industry.
